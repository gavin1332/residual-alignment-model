According to the US Department of Energy, a mature tree can produce 40 to 50 pounds of sugar and 100 pounds of oxygen in a single year. This equates to roughly 100,000 kWh of energy, which is enough to power a typical home for a year. To calculate this, we can use the formula E=mc2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light. Using this formula, 100,000 kWh is equivalent to 100 kg of sugar, which is 400,000 Joules/kg. This is then multiplied by the speed of light, which is 299,792,458 m/s, to get 100,000,000,000,000 Joules.
